// Exercise 1: Print the fact number 42 (in Uppercase) of the API response using Promises


// Exercise 2: Rewrite the previous example with async / await


// Exercise 3: Create a function to which you pass a callback to retrieve the response from the API
// and print the fact in reverse order (hola -> aloh) and still print at the end the same fact



// Exercise 4: Create 3 timers of (2, 3, and 5 seconds). Create a function which prints something after 10 seconds (after all the functions are called synchronously)


// Exercise 5: Recreate Promise.all with async / await, and use the previous timers. It should execute after 5 seconds
